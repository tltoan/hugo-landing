## 📊 Database Schema Details

### multiplayer_games
```sql
CREATE TABLE multiplayer_games (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  scenario_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  scenario_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  status game_status DEFAULT 'waiting',
  max_players INTEGER DEFAULT 4,
  current_players INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  game_data JSONB, -- LBO model state
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  started_at TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### game_players

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Real-time Synchronization Strategy
1. **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately, sync to server
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with timestamp comparison
3. **Delta Synchronization**: Send only changed cells, not entire state
4. **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection with state reconciliation

### Performance Considerations
- **Debounced Updates**: Batch rapid cell changes to reduce network traffic
- **Selective Subscriptions**: Only subscribe to relevant game channels
- **State Compression**: Use efficient data structures for large models
- **Caching Strategy**: Local state management with server synchronization

### Security Measures
- **Row Level Security**: Users can only access games they've joined
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all formula inputs and cell values
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse of real-time updates
- **Game Integrity**: Server-side validation of game rules and scoring

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Real-time latency < 100ms for cell updates
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for multiplayer games
- [ ] Support for 10+ concurrent players per game
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Game completion rate > 80%
- [ ] Average session duration > 15 minutes
- [ ] Player return rate > 60% within 7 days
- [ ] Positive user feedback on multiplayer experience

## 🚀 Launch Strategy

### Beta Testing Phase
1. **Internal Testing**: Team testing with 2-4 players
2. **Limited Beta**: Invite 10-20 users for feedback
3. **Public Beta**: Open to all registered users
4. **Full Launch**: Marketing and feature announcement
